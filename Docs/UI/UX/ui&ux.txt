To design the best UI & UX for a mobile-only fashion social commerce app where users can upload images, rate one another, and buy via shoppable links, you should focus on a seamless, engaging, and visually appealing experience that integrates social interaction with e-commerce functionality. Here's a detailed approach based on current best practices and trends:

Allow users to rate and comment on images, fostering community engagement.

Upload Page:

Simple, intuitive upload flow with options to tag items by color, type, brand, and style.
