Current Status Analysis

The permissions issue with deleting wardrobe items has been resolved through implementing a robust server-side API endpoint that properly authenticates users and manages database operations with admin privileges when needed. This fix provides a stable foundation to build enhanced social and monetization features.
Currently, the Lookbook application has:
A functional wardrobe system where users can add items with basic metadata
User profiles with social features
A look upload system where users share fashion content
Basic search functionality across the platform
Database tables for users, profiles, looks, wardrobe items, and rankings
Strategic Enhancements
Based on the virtual closet app case study and existing documentation, we can transform Lookbook from a basic fashion social network into a comprehensive fashion ecosystem with three integrated pillars:
Enhanced Personal Wardrobe - Building on existing wardrobe functionality
Social Fashion Discovery - Leveraging the social aspects of the platform
Fashion Marketplace - Adding monetization through affiliate links
