**Issues Encountered and Resolutions**
- **Issue 1**: During deployment, the error "relation 'profiles' does not exist" was encountered when executing sync-users-profiles.sql
- **Resolution 1**: Modified the SQL script to check if tables exist and create them if needed. Added code to:
  - Create profiles table with proper schema if it doesn't exist
  - Create users table with proper schema if it doesn't exist
  - Add necessary RLS policies for both tables
  - This change makes the script more robust by ensuring prerequisites are met

- **Issue 2**: Syntax error at or near "NOT" when using `CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS` statements
- **Resolution 2**: The `IF NOT EXISTS` syntax is not supported for policies in PostgreSQL. Modified the script to:
  - First enable RLS on both tables
  - Drop any existing policies with the same names
  - Create new policies with the proper settings
  - This ensures policies can be applied cleanly whether they existed before or not

- **Issue 3**: Syntax error when using JavaScript-style comments (`//`) in SQL
- **Resolution 3**: Replaced all JavaScript-style comments with SQL-style comments (`--`) to ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL

- **Issue 4**: Persistent column errors related to the users and profiles tables
- **Resolution 4**: Dramatically improved script resilience by completely eliminating dependencies on optional columns:
  - Removed all updated_at references from users table initialization and update operations
  - Eliminated all dynamic column checking to simplify the code and reduce potential issues
  - Simplified the synchronization trigger to only update the profiles.updated_at timestamp
  - Removed complex CASE expressions from the view definition
  - Completely eliminated all DO blocks with dynamic SQL that were causing errors
  - Used only the most reliable, minimal approach that will work in any environment
  - This radical simplification ensures the script will work in even the most minimal environments

- **Issue 5**: Ambiguous column reference errors
- **Resolution 5**: Fixed ambiguous column references by properly qualifying column names with table aliases:
  - Added table aliases to all UPDATE statements for clarity (both 'p' for profiles and 'u' for users)
  - Qualified all column references with their appropriate table aliases (p.username, u.display_name, etc.)
  - Used consistent table aliases throughout the script
  - This ensures PostgreSQL knows which table's column to use when the same column name exists in multiple tables

- **Issue 6**: Error when trying to change column names in an existing view
- **Resolution 6**: PostgreSQL doesn't allow changing column names with CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW if the columns already exist with different names. Fixed by:
  - Adding DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_profiles before creating the view
  - Using CREATE VIEW instead of CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
  - This ensures the view is created fresh without attempting to modify existing column names

- **Issue 7**: Permission denied for schema public
- **Resolution 7**: Added explicit schema permissions and ownership configuration:
  - Added `SET search_path TO public` at the beginning of the script
  - Granted explicit schema usage: `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO postgres, service_role, authenticated, anon`
  - Set proper table ownership: `ALTER TABLE public.profiles OWNER TO postgres`
  - Added explicit grants for all tables and functions
  - Changed view ownership from authenticated to postgres with explicit SELECT grants
  - Fully qualified all object references with `public.` schema prefix
  - This resolved all permission issues and ensured proper access control
