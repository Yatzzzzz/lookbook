## Current Issues Fixed
- [x] Fixed empty object error in API responses
- [x] Improved client resilience to API failures

- [x] Implemented early validation to catch invalid URLs before sending to API
- [x] Updated to use JWT authentication for secure API access
- [x] Added validation for try-on type parameter
- [x] Created .env.local with KLINGAI_ACCESS_KEY and KLINGAI_SECRET_KEY
- [x] Added automatic endpoint detection to handle API URL changes
- [x] Fixed localStorage quota exceeded error when storing large AI models
- [x] Fixed image size validation to prevent API errors with large images
- [x] Created unified try-on API route that combines KlingAI and local processing
- [x] Fixed hardcoded API keys in klingai-auth.ts
- [x] Added proper snake_case parameter naming for KlingAI API
- [x] Updated endpoint URLs to match official KlingAI documentation
- [x] Fixed base64 format to use bare string without data URI prefix
- [x] Added support for model_name parameter (v1 vs v1.5) based on try-on type
- [x] Implemented proper task polling for asynchronous KlingAI processing
- [x] Increased maximum image size to 10MB per KlingAI specifications
- [x] Fixed missing garment_image parameter validation in API requests
- [x] Fixed parameter name to use cloth_image instead of garment_image as required by KlingAI API

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the updated API with proper API key
- [ ] Implement user profile management
- [ ] Create social sharing functionality
- [ ] Build outfit gallery/feed component
- [ ] Add outfit saving and favoriting
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Investigate using fallback outfit images when KlingAI errors occur
- [ ] Add client-side image validation before upload
- [ ] Implement data compression for stored images

## Notes
- Current implementation uses KlingAI for virtual try-on functionality
- API errors now display meaningful placeholders instead of breaking the UI
- Server now properly handles and formats all types of API responses
- Specific error handling for KlingAI error codes improves user experience
- Switched from JWT authentication to simpler x-api-key authentication for KlingAI
- Requires KLINGAI_ACCESS_KEY and KLINGAI_SECRET_KEY environment variables to be set
- Multiple API endpoints are tried in sequence to ensure reliability
- Test route available at /api/tryon/test to validate API connectivity
- Safe storage utility implemented to handle browser storage limitations
- Image size validation prevents API errors with images larger than 10MB
- Unified API route combines KlingAI with local fallback processing
- Now using correct KlingAI endpoints and model naming (v1 vs v1.5)
- API requests properly formatted according to official documentation
- Enhanced validation ensures both human_image and cloth_image parameters are correctly provided
- Fixed parameter naming to use cloth_image instead of garment_image as required by the API

AZURE OPENAI INTEGRATION - IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

Core Focus:
✅ Image analysis with Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Vision model
✅ Direct integration with the Azure OpenAI API 
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Standardized fashion tag format (#Brand, #OutfitType, #Style, #Color, #Price)

Pages Created:
✅ Integrated Azure OpenAI directly with the main upload page
✅ Removed separate upload-azure page for simpler UX

API Endpoints:
✅ /api/clothes-finder - Image analysis with Azure OpenAI
✅ Tag extraction from Azure OpenAI responses
✅ Consistent tagging format for fashion items

Libraries/Utilities:
✅ Azure OpenAI helper function in azure-openai.ts
✅ REST API integration with appropriate headers and API version
✅ Basic application structure following Next.js standards
✅ No CSS libraries as per project requirements
✅ Safe storage utility to handle browser storage limitations

Next Steps:
1. Add connection status monitoring
2. Add support for specifying custom prompts
3. Optimize image processing for better results
4. Add batch processing
5. Implement additional Azure OpenAI features as needed

REMINDER: This application will be deployed on Azure Static Web Apps.
