## Authentication Configuration
- Azure OpenAI endpoint: https://lookbookalpha-openai-8a58.openai.azure.com/
- API key used: 3ed56bc6a47b4055b4bfb944df6a2395
- Deployment name: gpt-4o
- API version: 2024-02-15-preview
- KlingAI API URL: https://api.klingai.com
- KlingAI Access Key ID and Secret Key stored in env.local
- All credentials stored in environment variables (.env.local)
- Centralized configurations in lib/azure-openai.ts and lib/klingai.ts

## Next Steps
- Implement connection status monitoring
- Add ability to specify custom prompts
- Configure image optimization for better Azure OpenAI analysis results
- Implement batch processing capabilities
- Enhance the lookbook page
- Create proper database integration
- Deploy to Azure Static Web App

## Known Issues
- Azure OpenAI authentication requires correct deployment name verification
- LocalStorage has limitations (~5MB typically) but compression helps
- No database persistence for shared looks
- Camera might not work on all devices/browsers
- KlingAI API integration needs validation with actual endpoints

## Last Updated: 
Fixed virtual try-on integration with KlingAI API by implementing both client-side and server-side fallback authentication. Added proper handling of environment variables with a dedicated server endpoint for try-on requests. Created env-check API to verify configuration. Fixed image loading in the try-on page by adding proper null checking. Ensured real data and services are used throughout the application with no mock implementations. Added script to verify KlingAI credentials in env.local.
