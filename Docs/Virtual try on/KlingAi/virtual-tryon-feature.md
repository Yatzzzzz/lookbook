# Virtual Try-On Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Virtual Try-On feature allows users to visualize how clothing items would look on them before making a purchase decision or sharing with the fashion community. This implementation uses KlingAI API for image processing and realistic outfit simulation.

## Features
- Upload personal photos and clothing items separately
- Choose between full-body, upper-body, or lower-body try-on options
- Real-time processing with visual loading state feedback
- Error handling with clear user feedback
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Secure API authentication with JWT tokens

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
The implementation uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with KlingAI API following their specified format:
- Tokens include `iss` (issuer) set to the AccessKey
- Token expiration set to 30 minutes from generation time
- Token valid starting time set to 5 seconds before generation
- HMAC256 algorithm for signing with the SecretKey

### API Flow
1. User uploads their photo and a clothing item photo
2. Client sends base64-encoded images to the Virtual Try-On API endpoint
3. Server generates JWT token for KlingAI authentication
4. Server makes an authenticated request to KlingAI with user and clothing images
5. KlingAI processes the images and returns a URL with the try-on result
6. Server returns the result URL to the client
7. Client displays the processed image to the user

### Components
- `VirtualTryOn.tsx`: React component with UI for uploading and displaying images
- `klingai.ts`: Utility for KlingAI API authentication and requests
- `app/api/virtual-tryon/route.ts`: Next.js API route handler for the try-on feature
- `app/virtual-tryon/page.tsx`: Page component for the virtual try-on feature

### Error Handling
- Client-side validation ensures both images are uploaded before processing
- Loading states provide visual feedback during API processing
- Detailed error messages for various failure scenarios
- Graceful degradation with fallback options

## Integration
The virtual try-on feature is integrated into the main application with:
- Homepage link for easy access
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Mobile-first approach following project guidelines

## Environment Configuration
The feature requires the following environment variables:
```
KOLORS_AI_URL=https://api.klingai.com
KLINGAI_ACCESS_KEY=[your_access_key]
KLINGAI_SECRET_KEY=[your_secret_key]
```

## Future Enhancements
- Save try-on results to user gallery
- Share try-on results with the community
- Batch processing for multiple clothing items
- Customization options for lighting and positioning
- Improved image processing with better AI models

## Implementation Notes
- KlingAI endpoint specifics should be verified with the official documentation
- The actual endpoint names and request formats may need adjustment
- Consider adding image caching to improve performance
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
