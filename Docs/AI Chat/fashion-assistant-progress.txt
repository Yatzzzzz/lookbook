## Testing Notes
- Test on different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Test with different image types and sizes
- Test voice recognition in different environments
- Test with various fashion-related queries
- Verify model fallback works correctly under load
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Test live streaming mode on different network speeds
- Verify real-time conversation flow in live mode
- Test stop speaking functionality during responses
- Verify camera fallback mechanisms on restricted devices

## Troubleshooting Guide
- If camera doesn't initialize: Try refreshing the page or allow camera permissions
- If microphone doesn't work: Check browser permissions and try using Chrome
- If speech synthesis doesn't work: Try clicking the stop button and speak again
- If conversations feel stuck: Use the visual indicators to check device status
- For optimal performance, use Chrome on desktop or Android devices
- Safari users may need to enable microphone and camera separately
- If the bot doesn't stop speaking, use the orange stop button to interrupt

- Gemini API key in .env.local (GEMINI_API_KEY)
- Web Speech API supported browser for voice features
- Camera access for photo analysis
- Secure context (HTTPS) for camera and microphone access on production
