# Fashion Social Network Deployment Plan

## Project Overview
- **Project**: Fashion Social Network with Azure Static Web App deployment
- **Focus**: Porting components from existing project at `c:\lookbook` to current project
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4 with Supabase integration and Gemini AI

## Source Analysis
Source project located at `c:\lookbook` contains:

### Pages to Port
1. **Gallery** - Contains sliders, image components, username+avatar
2. **Look** - Complete page with all subdirectories:
   - battle, camera, details, id, opinions, preview, share, upload, yay-or-nay
3. **Lookbook** - With additional features:
   - checkout, analytics popup, wallet, delivery, settings

### Components Structure
- Gallery components include GalleryCard and GalleryFilter
- Look page uses client components with complex subdirectory structure
- Lookbook uses client-side rendering with page.client.tsx approach

## Current Project Structure
- Next.js App Router structure
- Already contains initial gallery, look, and lookbook directories
- Uses Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
- Supabase for backend services
- React 19 (newer than source project)
